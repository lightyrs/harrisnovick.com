Application
===========

Put your application-specific files here, but leave your third party libraries in the vendor directory.

The directory structure otherwise is pretty straightforwards.

* Jade template snippets go in `./templates` and are included into `index.static.jade`
* Stylus CSS goes in `./styl`
* Custom JS goes in `./javascripts`
* Static assets, like images and fonts, go into /assets
